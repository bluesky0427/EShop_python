Phase 1: Prototype (Proof of Understanding)
Target: Parse & index 2 XML feeds (e.g., ekos & beq), deploy minimal backend on a temporary server, show fast search.

1. Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI or Node.js (whichever you prefer; I suggest FastAPI for async XML handling + performance)

Database: PostgreSQL (with JSONB fields where needed), using proper indexing strategies (GIN, trigram)

Search Engine: Typesense (self-hosted) or Algolia (if SaaS is acceptable for now)

Automation: n8n for scheduled feed fetching/parsing (daily or per need)

Hosting: Will run sample on any VPS (e.g., Render, Fly.io, or even a local VM with port forwarding)

2. Key Features
Normalize XML into tables: products, shops, brands, categories, colors, sizes

Handle nested/variant structures in XML (e.g., multiple sizes/colors per product)

Create search API with filters: title, EAN, brand, price, availability, etc.

Add AI typo correction/synonyms (OpenAI API or prebuilt typo libraries, optional at this stage)

‚öôÔ∏è Sample Backend Demo Plan
I‚Äôll:

Fetch and parse https://ekos.gr/xml_feed/skroutz_ekos.xml and https://beq.gr/xml_feed/skroutz_beq.xml

Normalize and store ~50K‚Äì100K products into PostgreSQL

Index into Typesense for fast search with filters

Expose API endpoints like:

sql
Copy
Edit
GET /search?title=printer&brand=HP&min_price=50&max_price=200&availability=true
GET /product/:ean
Show a minimal search frontend using your current frontend (marketgr) for preview.

üí° Scalable Architecture
Built to support 5,000 XML feeds:

Feed metadata and logs stored per e-shop

Deduplication logic (by EAN/MPN) across shops

Scheduled refresh (with retry/failure handling)

Horizontal scaling ready: separate workers for ingestion, enrichment, and indexing

‚úÖ What I need from you to start:
Confirmation to proceed with the 2-shop prototype

Optional access to your Netlify frontend (or I‚Äôll just mock search calls to match it)

If you have preferred categories mapping, send that too (for normalization)
